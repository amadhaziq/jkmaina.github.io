Concepts and patterns
Artificial intelligence today often works through agents that can perceive, think, plan, and act. An agent is not just a single model; it‚Äôs a system that combines perception, memory, reasoning, and action. You can think of an agent as a small software unit that can decide what to do next based on what it has observed and what it knows.

- Perception
  - Agents observe inputs from various sources, such as API responses, sensor data, or user messages.
  - Perception modules translate raw data into meaningful signals an agent can reason about.

- Memory
  - Short-term memory stores recent context to support decisions.
  - Long-term memory maintains information across sessions, enabling continuity and learning over time.

- Reasoning and planning
  - Planning components help agents decide sequences of actions to reach a goal.
  - Reasoning modules evaluate evidence, weigh options, and handle uncertainty.

- Action
  - Agents perform tasks via actions such as API calls, database updates, or user interactions.
  - Action modules include safeguards to prevent unsafe or undesired outcomes.

- Autogen and automation
  - Autogen workflows enable automatic generation of prompts, action plans, and code scaffolds.
  - These patterns speed up development and reduce repetitive work while maintaining quality and consistency.

- OpenAI and Google agent ecosystems
  - OpenAI Agents SDK provides an interface to build orchestrated agent systems.
  - Google Agents SDK offers complementary capabilities and tooling for agent-centric workflows.

- Language tools and graph structures
  - LangChain and LangGraph enable chain-of-thought reasoning, memory integration, and graph-based planning.
  - These ideas help agents organize thoughts, store results, and reuse prior decisions.

- Transformers, embeddings, and tool integration
  - Leveraging HuggingFace models and embeddings helps agents understand and process textual data.
  - Tool integration enables agents to call external services, access data sources, and perform actions in the real world.

- Safety, reliability, and governance
  - Build in checks, rate limits, and guardrails to maintain safe agent behavior.
  - Use logs and audits to understand agent decisions and improve performance over time.
